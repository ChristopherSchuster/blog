Command Pattern, Java and Python Example
<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern">Wikipedia</a>
In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to represent and encapsulate all the information needed to call a method at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters. This post shows an
example implemented on Java and Python.

<h3>Multilevel Undo Example</h3>
<p>Lest suppouse that we have an editor, an user can copy , cut and paste text inside a screen. If all user 
actions in this program are implemented as command objects, the program can keep a stack of 
the most recently executed commands. When the user wants to undo a command, the program simply pops the most 
recent command object and executes its undo() method.
</p>

<h3>Java Implementation</h3>
<h5>The Receiver</h5>
<p>Is the object that will be manipulated by a command, in this particular example the Receiver Object is 
a Screen Object.
</p>

<pre>
    package co.ntweb;

    public class Screen {
        private StringBuffer text;

        public Screen(String text){
            this.text = new StringBuffer(text);
        }

        public String cut(int start, int end){
            String str = this.text.substring(start, end);
            this.text.delete(start, end);
            return str;
        }

        public String copy(int start, int end){
            return this.text.substring(start, end);
        }

        public void paste(int offset, String str){
            this.text.insert(offset, str);
        }

        public String toString(){
            return this.text.toString();
        }

        public int length(){
            return this.text.length();
        }
    }
</pre>

<h5>Command Objects</h5>
<p> Command Object implents all the logic that the command needs, this include undo instructions and screen 
state before execute command.</p>
